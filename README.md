# ADHD_ThinkAloudStudy
These are the materials used in my Think Aloud study conducted in 2024 for any interested in replication, or conducting a similar study.

The code is in a broken and unbroken state, with the unbroken code being in a state where it should be able to run normally without edits. 

The broken code contains two logic and two compilation errors. The errors are as follows:
- The use of = instead of == in line 13 of Pawn.java
- A missing ; at the end of line 21 in ChessBoard.java
- The use of Queen instead of Pawn at line 37 in ChessBoard.java
- The use of Wizard.jpg rather than EmptySquare.jpg at line 94 in ChessPiece.java
